# Hands on Machine learning :school:
Welcome to the Hands-On Machine Learning Implementation project! This repository is dedicated to learning machine learning concepts by implementing them from scratch and comparing the results with the practices outlined in the renowned book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

## Overview 
This project serves as a practical learning resource for individuals interested in delving deep into machine learning algorithms and techniques. By implementing algorithms from scratch, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of their underlying principles, enabling you to grasp the nuances and intricacies that often remain obscured in high-level libraries.

## Key Features:
- Implementation from Scratch: Dive into the core of machine learning algorithms by coding them from scratch using Python.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare the performance and behavior of your implementations with those provided in the "Hands-On Machine Learning" book, providing valuable insights and understanding.
- Hands-On Learning: Through practical implementation and experimentation, reinforce your understanding of machine learning concepts and methodologies.
Educational Resource: This project serves as an educational tool for both beginners and experienced practitioners looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning.
## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
